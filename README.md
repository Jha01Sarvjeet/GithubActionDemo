## Introduction

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform integrated directly into GitHub repositories, allowing you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying your code. This guide covers various aspects of GitHub Actions, including its core concepts and a demo workflow to illustrate how to create, run, and check results.

## What is GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) service that enables you to automate tasks within your software development lifecycle. With GitHub Actions, you can create custom workflows directly in your GitHub repository, triggered by events such as code pushes, pull requests, or scheduled tasks

## Key Features:

Automation: Automate repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.

Integration:  Easily integrate with other services and tools using pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace.

Customization: Write custom actions in any programming language or script.

Parallel Execution: Run multiple jobs in parallel to speed up your workflows.

Community: Leverage a vast community of pre-built actions and reusable components.

## Example Use Cases:

CI/CD Pipelines: Automatically build, test, and deploy your applications.

Issue Management: Automatically label issues or close stale issues.

Code Quality: Run static code analysis and linters on every pull request.

Notification: Send notifications to team members via Slack or email when certain events occur.


## Components of GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that makes web development smooth and quick. Wondering what mechanisms make GitHub Actions work so well?
Letâ€™s learn about them.

## Workflow
A workflow is a programmed process that runs one or more jobs. This configurable process is defined by a YAML file in the .github/workflows directory in a repository. This repository can have several workflows. And each workflow can perform a different set of jobs.

For instance, you can use one workflow to create and test pull requests while another to deploy your application.

## Events
An event is a particular activity in a repository. It is like a trigger for workflows. When events occur within a repository, GitHub Actions respond to them. These events can push requests, pull requests, or other actions.

## Jobs
Jobs are a set of steps in a workflow. They are executed under the same runner. Each step is either a shell script or an action. Scripts execute while actions run.

## Action
An action is an application for the GitHub Actions. It performs frequently repeated tasks. The application helps web developers to reduce the number of repetitive codes they write in their workflow files.

## Runner
A runner is a server that runs workflows when they are triggered. One runner can perform a single task at a time.
